* 1. What's this?

The main purpose of this elisp is to handle each tree in an org buffer as a slide by simple narrowing. This emacs lisp is a minor mode for Emacs Org-mode. 

Main features:

  - Live editable presentation
  - Fast switching of narrowing/widen
  - TODO pursuit with narrowing
  - Displaying the current number of slides in mode line
  - CONTENT view during a presentation
  - Slide-in effect
  - Slide header from org file's header
  - Countdown timer 

** 1-1. Related packages

There are various packages to make a presentation with org-mode. See [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/non-beamer-presentations.html]].

* 2. Install

1. Put this elisp into your load-path
2. Add =(require 'org-tree-slide)= in your =.emacs=

OR

1. Eval: =(auto-install-from-url "https://raw.github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide/master/org-tree-slide.el")= (for auto-install users)
2. Add =(require 'org-tree-slide)= in your =.emacs=

Then open an org file, just type =C-<= and =C->=, which means =C-M-,= and =C-M-.=, you can see a presentation will begin with a header, slide-in effect, and slide number in mode line.

** 2.1 el-get recipe

If you are an [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] user, just do

: M-x el-get-install RET org-tree-slide

** 2.2 MELPA

Now, you can install `org-tree-slide' via [[http://melpa.org/#/org-tree-slide][MELPA]].

** 2.2 Requirements
  - Org-mode 6.33x or higher version is required.
  - This elisp doesn't require any additional packages.

* 3. Recommended settings

Assigning a single key to =org-tree-slide-mode= is recommended.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle)
#+END_SRC

OR

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-mode)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle)
#+END_SRC

* 4. Profiles

Three useful profiles are available. Please select a profile that is the most suitable for your using scenario.

If you select =simple= profile, call the following command while =org-tree-slide-mode= is ON.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x org-tree-slide-simple-profile
#+END_SRC

If you want to use this setting as the default, put the following configuration including recommended settings into your =.emacs=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (require 'org-tree-slide nil t)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-mode)
  (global-set-key (kbd "S-<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle)
  (org-tree-slide-simple-profile))
#+END_SRC

=org-tree-slide-presentation-profile= and =org-tree-slide-narrowing-control-profile= are also available.

** 4-1. `Simple'

This profile will display trees in your org buffer by simple narrowing. You can change trees without =widen= command. Most of the visual effect is disabled.

Type =M-x org-tree-slide-simple-profile= while =org-tree-slide-mode= is ON.

    1. No header display
    2. No slide-in effect
    3. The cursor will move to the head of the buffer when exit
    4. No slide number display in mode line
    5. Display every type of tree except =org-comment-string= (e.g. COMMENT)

** 4-2. `Presentation'

This profile is the default setting of org-tree-slide. If an org buffer includes =#+TITLE:=, =#+EMAIL:=, and =#+AUTHOR:=, org-tree-slide attempts to use those variables in the slide header. A date in the header will be set with the presentation of the day. You can enjoy a slide-in effect, the current slide number in mode line. 

# A presentation with a count down timer is started by =M-x org-tree-slide-play-with-timer=.

If you want to show the content of your presentation, type =C-x s c= or =M-x org-tree-slide-content=. All of the headings will be shown in a buffer like a Table Of Content except some headings configured as skipping by =org-tree-slide-slip-outline-level=. Find a heading that you want to show, and type =C->=, the presentation will be resumed.

It is possible to skip slides when a heading level is higher than or equal to a  value of =org-tree-slide-skip-outline-level=. see User variables.

To exit a presentation, set =org-tree-slide-mode= OFF. The cursor move to the head of the buffer and the trees will be rendered according to the value of =#+STARTUP:= if possible.

=M-x org-tree-slide-presentation-profile=

    1. Display header
    2. Enable slide-in effect
    3. The cursor will move to the head of buffer when exit
    4. Display slide number in mode line
    5. Display every type of tree except =org-comment-string= (e.g. COMMENT)

** 4-3. `TODO Pursuit with narrowing'

This profile will display trees restricted to =TODO status= without a header and slide-in effect. It is very useful to concentrate your focus on the current TODO item that is not done, and go to the next task by typing of =C->=. This is "TODO Pursuit with narrowing". If you want to track every kind of tree including finished items, toggle =M-x org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle= OFF.

When you exit =org-tree-slide-mode=, the cursor will keep the same position, it is therefore possible to focus again by toggle =M-x org-tree-slide-mode=.

If you feel the cursor moving is very slow, please change a value of =org-tree-slide-modeline-display= to ='outside= or =nil=.

=M-x org-tree-slide-narrowing-control-profile=

    1. No header display
    2. No slide-in effect
    3. The cursor will keep the same position when exit
    4. Display slide number in mode line
    5. Display TODO trees only except =org-comment-string= (e.g. COMMENT)

** 5-1. Useful settings for experts

If you like this elisp, the following setting is more useful. Try it!

In this case, =<f8>= / =<f9>= / =<f10>= / =<f11>= are assigned in order to control org-tree-slide.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (require 'org-tree-slide nil t)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-mode)
  (global-set-key (kbd "S-<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle)
  (define-key org-tree-slide-mode-map (kbd "<f9>")
    'org-tree-slide-move-previous-tree)
  (define-key org-tree-slide-mode-map (kbd "<f10>")
    'org-tree-slide-move-next-tree)
  (define-key org-tree-slide-mode-map (kbd "<f11>")
    'org-tree-slide-content)
  (setq org-tree-slide-skip-outline-level 4)
  (org-tree-slide-narrowing-control-profile)
  (setq org-tree-slide-skip-done nil)))
#+END_SRC
